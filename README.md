## Instructions:

- Create the `songs` in this root directory to save your albums/playlists.

### Inside each playlist, there are 3 important things:

1. **Your songs**: Name them in this format:
   ```html
   <Artist Name> - <Song Name>

2. **info.json**: This file contains metadata about the playlist. Its structure is as follows:
   {
    "description": "Dance to the sounds of West",
    "cover": "coverPic.jpg"
   }

3. **coverPic**: The cover picture's filename is fetched from the JSON file.
